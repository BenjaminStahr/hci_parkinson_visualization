# Inside Out: Visualizing Parkinson's Disease and Deep Brain Stimulation

"Inside Out" is a university project aimed at visualizing Parkinson's disease (PD) and deep brain stimulation (DBS) to assist patients in better understanding their condition and treatment options. The project leverages augmented reality (AR) and 3D printing to offer an educational tool that bridges the gap between complex medical concepts and patient comprehension.

## Project Overview

This project uses a 3D model of the brain, enhanced with AR through an Android application built using Unity and the Vuforia framework. The app visually represents key affected brain areas in Parkinsonâ€™s disease and demonstrates the effects of DBS. The application aims to assist both patients and physicians by providing an interactive tool that clarifies complex medical details, reduces patient anxiety about treatments like DBS, and improves decision-making regarding therapy plans.

### Key Features:
- **AR and 3D Printing**: Combines a real-world model with an interactive 3D AR overlay to explain affected brain regions.
- **Focus on Parkinson's Disease**: Explains symptoms like tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia by highlighting affected areas such as the Substantia Nigra, Subthalamic Nucleus, and Globus Pallidus.
- **Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)**: Visualizes DBS targets and demonstrates how electrical impulses help alleviate PD symptoms.
- **Modes**:
  - **Information Mode**: Provides general information about damaged brain areas.
  - **Affected Areas Mode**: Highlights brain areas affected by Parkinson's progression.
  - **DBS Mode**: Visualizes the placement and function of DBS electrodes.

## Experiment Design

To assess the usability and effectiveness of the app, a preliminary evaluation was conducted using a think-aloud protocol and semi-structured interviews. Feedback from participants, including a person with tremor symptoms, provided valuable insights into improving the application.

### Results

Following, collected suggestions from the participants are shown:
- Simplify technical terminology for patient comprehension.
- Improve orientation cues to help users identify the front and back of the brain.
- Increase button sizes to accommodate users with motor difficulties (e.g., tremor).
- Enhance the visual clarity of the brain model by adjusting colors and highlights.
  
Despite the suggestions for improvement, participants noted that the application has great potential in enhancing patient understanding of complex diseases like Parkinson's. They found that the use of augmented reality combined with a 3D model provided a clear, engaging, and effective way to explain Parkinson's disease and deep brain stimulation therapy. They also highlighted that this approach could improve patient confidence in making informed decisions regarding their treatment options.
